# Automation Environment Setup

## 1. Install the necessary tools:
- Selenium (for Python): `pip install selenium`
- pytest for running tests: `pip install pytest`

## 2. Configure the environment:
- Set up a new project directory.
- Initialize the project:
  - Create `tests/`, `config/`, `utils/`, and `reports/` directories.
  - Create `requirements.txt` and add `selenium` and `pytest`.
  
## 3. Verify the setup by running a sample test:
- Run `pytest tests/` to ensure everything is set up correctly.
